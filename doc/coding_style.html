<H1>Daala Coding Style</H1>
<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>
This document defines the coding style of the Daala project.
In general, Daala tries to conform to C89, and avoid features which are not
 available in C89 in portable code.
We try to minimize our dependence on libc (e.g., using macros around memory
 allocation functions).
</P>

</PRE>
<P>
Make sure the copyright years are up to date.
</P>
<P>
In general, it is not necessary to list invididual copyright holders in each
 file (beyond "Daala project contributors").
Xiph does not require assignment of copyright.
</P>
<H3>Globals</H3>
<P>
Non-const global variables in portable code are not allowed.
They make it impossible to write re-entrant code without introducing a
 dependency on a threading library.
</P>
<H3>Naming</H3>
<P>
All functions and types use the canonical C naming scheme: all lowercase with
 underscores for separators.
<CODE>#define</CODE>s and global const variables use all uppercase with
 underscores for separators.
</P>
<P>
All functions and types begin with an <CODE>od_</CODE> prefix.
All <CODE>#define</CODE>s and global const variables begin with an
 <CODE>OD_</CODE> prefix.
</P>
<P>
Do not prefix names with single letters indicating their role (m for member
 variables, k for constants, g for globals, etc.).
</P>
<P>
Do not use leading or trailing underscores in regular code.
</P>
<P>
Macro definitions which need to declare local variables should append two
 trailing underscores to their name to avoid conflicts with regular code.
</P>
<H3>Constructors/Destructors</H3>
<P>
Initialization and deinitialization routines for type <CODE>od_foo</CODE> are
 named <CODE>od_foo_init()</CODE> and <CODE>od_foo_clear()</CODE>.
These should take an already-allocated pointer to an object of the appropriate
 type.
If allocating versions of these functions are desired, they should be named
 <CODE>od_foo_create()</CODE> and <CODE>od_foo_free()</CODE>, and dispatch to
 <CODE>od_foo_init()</CODE> and <CODE>od_foo_clear()</CODE> respectively.
</P>

<H2>Formatting</H2>
<H3>Tabs</H3>
<P>
There are no tabs in source code.
Do not use them, ever.
</P>
<H3>Trailing Whitespace</H3>
<P>
Remove all trailing whitespace at the end of a line.
</P>
<H3>Indentation</H3>
<P>
Use two-space indenting.
</P>
<H3>Line Length</H3>
<P>
Lines should be no more than 79 characters.
This allows them to be displayed fully in a standard terminal even in diffs.
The extra column on the right also makes long lines easier to spot.
</P>
<H3>Line Wrapping</H3>
If a line needs to be continued on to the next line, use a single additional
 space for all subsequent lines.
Do not align subsequent lines with <CODE>=</CODE> operators, function
 parameters, etc.
Do not add additional indentation to indicate open parentheses, etc.
If this produces lines you think are confusing, break them up into multiple
 statements.
</P>
<P>
Prefer wrapping at lower-precedence operators.
</P>
<P>
Prefer making wrapped lines as close in length as possible, while minimizing
 the total number of lines.
</P>
<P>
All unary operators and the binary operators <CODE>+</CODE>, <CODE>-</CODE>,
 <CODE>&amp;&amp;</CODE>, and <CODE>||</CODE> belong to the start of the next
 line, not the end of the previous line.
</P>
<H3><CODE>struct</CODE> fields and local variables</CODE></H3>
<P>
One variable/field per declaration (e.g., do not use
 <CODE>int x, y, z;</CODE>).
</P>
<P>
Do not attempt to align variable/field names.
</P>
<P>
Do not initialize variables in the declaration.
This makes it harder to follow C89's "no declarations after a statement" rule
 and can hide logic errors that would be exposed by valgrind.
</P>
<H3>Comments</H3>
<P>
Do not use C++ comments (<CODE>//</CODE>).
</P>
<P>
Write properly punctuated comments that start with a capital letter.
</P>
<P>
Do not put comments to the right of code.
Put them on a separate line.
</P>
<P>
Format multi-line comments as follows:
</P>
<PRE>
/*This is a multi-line comment.
  Each sentence starts on a new line, and all subsequent lines in the same
   sentence are indented a single space, making it easier to change the comment
   without re-flowing a whole paragraph.
  This gives better "blame" information, and makes diffs easier to read.

  Other notes:
  - Start the first sentence on the same line as the start of the comment, and
     do not add a space in front of it.
    The former ensures that single-line and multi-line comments have the same
     style, making it easier to convert between the two.
    The latter maximizes the space available for prose in heavily-indented
     code.
  - Align the start of subsequent sentences with the start of the first one.
  - End the comment on the same line as the last sentence, and do not add an
     extra space after that sentence.*/
</PRE>
<H3>Preprocessor Statements</H3>
<P>
All pre-processor statements begin with a <CODE>#</CODE> in the leftmost
 column.
Indent pre-processor statements by adding spaces after the <CODE>#</CODE>, not
 before it.
</P>
<P>
Preprocessor statements inside an
 <CODE>#if</CODE>/<CODE>#else</CODE>/<CODE>#endif</CODE> block are indented by
 one space per level (after the leading <CODE>#</CODE>).
</P>
<P>
Use <CODE>#if [!]defined(X)</CODE> instead of <CODE>#if[n]def X</CODE>.
The former makes it easier to extend to multiple conditions, zero out, etc.,
 e.g., replacing
<PRE>
#if defined(X)
</PRE>
with
<PRE>
#if defined(X) &amp;&amp; 0
</PRE>
</P>
<H3>Blank Lines</H3>
<P>
There should never be more than a single blank line in a row.
</P>
<P>
Do not add blank lines in the interior of a function, except inside of a
 multi-line comment.
If you find yourself wanting to do this, use two functions instead.
</P>
<H3>Operator Spacing</H3>
<P>
All non-unary operators with the precedence of <CODE>+</CODE> and
 <CODE>-</CODE> or less should have one space on either side, except for
 commas, which have a single following space.
</P>
<P>
There is no space before the opening parenthesis of a function call argument
 list, nor after a closing parenthesis followed by a comma or a semicolon.
</P>
<P>
Semicolons in <CODE>for</CODE> loop iterators also have a single following
 space, except when the following statement is empty.
</P>
<H3>Pointers</H3>
<P>
The <CODE>*</CODE> in pointer types hugs the variable name, not the type name.
</P>
<H3>Braces</H3>
<P>
Opening braces go on the same line as the start of the construct they are
 opening (function body, <CODE>if</CODE>, <CODE>else</CODE>, <CODE>for</CODE>,
 <CODE>do</CODE>, <CODE>while</CODE>, <CODE>switch</CODE>, etc.), separated by
 a single space.
</P>
<P>
Do not put spaces in empty braces.
</P>
<P>
Closing braces go on a line by themselves, indented at the same level as the
 opening line.
</P>
<H3>Array Initializers</H3>
<P>
If an array initializer fits on a single line, put a single space inside the
 brace on each end.
</P>
<P>
If an array initializer does not fit on a single line, do not wrap it as one
 long line.
Instead, start a new line after the opening brace and indent the initialization
 data.
Start new lines of initialization data as necessary, without the additional one
 space used to indent wrapped lines.
</P>
<P>
For multi-line multidimensional array initializers, place the comma on the same
 line as the closing brace for the inner array, and start the opening brace for
 the next element of the outer array on a new line.
</P>
<H3>Trailing Commas</H3>
<P>
Do not include trailing commas in array initializers, enums, or other lists.
These cause warnings on some platforms.
</P>
<H3>Parentheses</H3>
<P>
Do not use syntactically unnecessary parentheses unless they would generate a
 warning with gcc or MSVC.
</P>
<P>
Parentheses should be placed around every single-expression macro definition,
 including constants.
</P>
<H3>Keywords</H3>
<P>
A single space follows <CODE>if</CODE>, <CODE>for</CODE>, <CODE>while</CODE>,
 and <CODE>switch</CODE> keywords, before the parenthesized expression.
</P>
<P>
An <CODE>else</CODE> and the <CODE>while</CODE> in a <CODE>do</CODE> ...
 <CODE>while</CODE> loop begin on a new line, instead of being placed on the
 same line as the closing brace from the previous block.
If the <CODE>else</CODE>'s statement is a subsequent <CODE>if</CODE>, that
 <CODE>if</CODE> is placed on the same line as the <CODE>else</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
If you omit the <CODE>break</CODE> after a non-empty <CODE>case</CODE>
 statement where control reaches the end of the block, add a comment indicating
 you are falling through.
If control reaches the end of the block in the last <CODE>case</CODE> statement
 in a <CODE>switch</CODE> block, do not omit the <CODE>break</CODE>.
Use braces around the body of a <CODE>case</CODE> statement, unless the body is
 a single statement (excluding the <CODE>break</CODE>) and fits on one line
 (including the <CODE>break</CODE>).
</P>
<P>
Loop or conditional bodies with a single statement may be placed on the same
 line as the start of the loop/conditional without any braces.
Such loops can easily be stepped over in a debugger.
This is allowed even for <CODE>if</CODE> statements with an <CODE>else</CODE>
 clause.
If a loop/conditional body has to extend to multiple lines for any reason
 (including exceeding the 79-character line limit, even if still a single
 statement), then it must be contained in braces (and the first statement start
 on a new line).
</P>
<P>
Use <CODE>for (;;)</CODE> for infinite loops, not <CODE>while (1)</CODE>.
Some compilers complain about conditional expressions that always evaluate to
 true.
</P>
<P>
<CODE>return</CODE> values are separated from the keyword by a single space,
 and are not enclosed in parentheses.
</P>
<H4>Examples:</H4>
<PRE>
for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) x[i] = 0;
</PRE>
<PRE>
do something();
while (!done);
</PRE>
<PRE>
while (!done) {
  do_something();
  do_something_else();
}
</PRE>
<PRE>
if (test) do_this();
else do_that();
</PRE>
<PRE>
if (condition) {
  do_one_thing();
  then_another();
}
else if (another_condition) do_something_else();
</PRE>
<PRE>
switch (value) {
  case 1: {
    int foo;
    foo = compute_foo();
    use_foo(foo);
    break;
  }
  case 2: ignore_foo();
  /*Fall through.*/
  case 3: return -1;
  default: handle_default(); break;
}
</PRE>

<H2>Functions</H2>
<H3>Declarations</H3>
<P>
Put the return type and parameters on the same line as the function name,
 wrapping as necessary.
Do not attempt to align the function names in a group of functions with
 different return types.
</P>
<H3>Function Parameter Ordering</H3>
<P>
If the function is associated with a single object, put that object first.
</P>
<P>
If the function has both inputs and outputs, the outputs go before the inputs
 (like memcpy(), which was designed to mimic the assignment operator).
</P>
<P>
When taking a variable-length array, the length/size/stride of the array goes
 after the pointer to the array.
</P>

<H2>Header Files</H2>
<H3>The #define guard</H3>
<P>
All header files should be wrapped in a define guard as follows:
<PRE>
#if !defined(_path_file_H)
# define _path_file_H (1)
...
#endif
</PRE>
Path elements should be sparated by underscores.
The leading <CODE>src</CODE> component of the path is omitted.
Path/file names should be lower case (as identifiers which match
 <CODE>_[A-Z].*</CODE> are reserved by POSIX).
</P>
<H3>Forward Declarations</H3>
<P>
Do not forward declare things in order to avoid additional includes.
Processing includes is fast in C, unlike C++, where they contain most of the
 code, and recompiling C is also fast.
It's not worth the maintenance burden of having one thing defined in many
 places to avoid including some extra files.
</P>
<P>
In header files which have circular dependencies, put any typedefs at the top,
 before including the headers which produce the cycle.
</P>
<H3>Inline Functions</H3>
<P>
Do not put inline functions in headers except in platform-specific sections.
The inline keyword is not available in C89.
Do not use static functions in headers as a substitute, as they generate
 warnings if unused.
</P>
