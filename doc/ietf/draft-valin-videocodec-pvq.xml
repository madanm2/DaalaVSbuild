    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
      This draft describes a proposal for adapting the Opus <xref
      target="RFC6716">RFC 6716</xref> energy conservation
      principle to video coding based on a pyramid vector quantizer (PVQ)
      <xref target="PVQ"/>.
      One potential advantage of conserving energy of the AC coefficients in
      video coding is preserving textures rather than low-passing them.
      Also, by introducing a fixed-resolution PVQ-type quantizer, we
      automatically gain a simple activity masking model.</t>

      <t>The main challenge of adapting this scheme to video is that we have a
      good prediction (the reference frame), so we are essentially starting
      from a point that is already on the PVQ hyper-sphere,
      rather than at the origin like in CELT.
      Other challenges are the introduction of a quantization matrix and the
      fact that we want the reference (motion predicted) data to perfectly
      correspond to one of the entries in our codebook.

    <section title="Gain-Shape Coding and Activity Masking">
      <t>The main idea behind the proposed video coding scheme is to code
      groups of DCT coefficient as a scalar gain and a unit-norm "shape" vector.
      A block's AC coefficients may all be part of the same group, or may be
      divided by frequency (e.g. by octave) and/or by directionality (horizontal
      vs vertical). 
      </t>
      <t>It is desirable for a single quality parameter to control the resolution
      of both the gain and the shape. 
      Ideally, that quality parameter should also take into account activity
      masking, that is, the fact that the eye is less sensitive to regions of
      an image that have more details.
      According to Jason Garrett-Glaser, the perceptual analysis in the x264
      encoder uses a resolution proportional to the variance of the AC
      coefficients raised to the power a, with a=0.173.
      For gain-shape quantization, this is equivalent to using a resolution
      of g^(2a), where g is the gain.
      We can derive a scalar quantizer that follows this resolution:
<figure align="center">
<artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
                 b
      g=Q_g gamma     ,
]]></artwork>
</figure>
      where gamma is the gain quantization index, b=1/(1-2*a) and Q_g is the gain resolution
      and main quality parameter.
      </t>
      <t>An important aspect of the current proposal is the use of prediction.
      In the case of the gain, there is usually a significant correlation
      with the gain of neighboring blocks.
      One way to predict the gain of a block is to compute the gain of the
      coefficients obtained through intra or inter prediction.
      Another way is to use the encoded gain of the neighboring blocks to
      explicitly predict the gain of the current block. 
      </t>
    </section>



    <section title="Householder Reflection">
      <t>Let vector x_d denote the (pre-normalization) DCT band to be coded in
      the current block and vector r_d denote the corresponding reference
      (based on intra prediction or motion compensation), the encoder 
      computes and encodes the "band gain" g = sqrt(x_d^T x_d). 
      The normalized band is computed as
<figure align="center">
<artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
             x_d
      x = --------- ,
          || x_d ||
]]></artwork>
</figure>
      with the normalized reference r similarly computed based on r_d.
      The encoder then finds the position and sign of the maximum value in r:
<figure align="center">
<artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
      m = argmax_i | r_i |
      s = sign(r_m)
]]></artwork>
</figure>
      and computes the Householder reflection that reflects r to -s e_m.
      The reflection vector is given by
<figure align="center">
<artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
      v = r + s e_m .
]]></artwork>
</figure>
      The encoder reflects the normalized band to find the unit-norm vector
<figure align="center">
<artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
                v^T x
      z = x - 2 -----  v .
                v^T v
]]></artwork>
</figure> 
      </t>

      <t>The closer the current band is from the reference band, the closer
      z is from -s e_m. 
      This can be represented either as an angle, or as a coordinate on a
      projected pyramid.
      </t>
    </section>



    <section title="Angle-Based Encoding">
      <t>Assuming no quantization, the similarity can be represented by the angle
<figure align="center">
<artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
      theta = arccos(-s z_m) .
]]></artwork>
</figure>
      If theta is quantized and transmitted to the decoder, then z can be
      reconstructed as
<figure align="center">
<artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
      z = -s cos(theta) e_m + sin(theta) z_r ,
]]></artwork>
</figure>
      where z_r is a unit vector based on z that excludes dimension m.
      </t>

      <t>
      The vector z_r can be quantized using PVQ.
      Let y be a vector of integers that satisfies
<figure align="center">
<artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
      sum_i(|y[i]|) = K ,
]]></artwork>
</figure>
      with K determined in advance, then the PVQ search finds the vector y
      that maximizes y^T z_r / (y^T y) . The quantized version of z_r is
<figure align="center">
<artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
                y
      z_rq = ------- .
             || y ||
]]></artwork>
</figure>
      </t>
      
      <t>If we assume that MSE is a good criterion for optimizing the resolution,
      then the angle quantization resolution should be (roughly) 
<figure align="center">
<artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
                   dg       1        b
      Q_theta = ---------*----- = ------ .
                 d(gamma)   g      gamma
]]></artwork>
</figure>
      To derive the optimal K we need to consider the normalized distortion for a
      Laplace-distributed variable found experimentally to be approximately
<figure align="center">
<artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
            (N-1)^2 + C*(N-1)
      D_p = ----------------- ,
                 24*K^2
]]></artwork>
</figure>
      with C ~= 4.2. The distortion due to the gain is
<figure align="center">
<artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
            b^2*Q_g^2*gamma^(2*b-2)
      D_g = ----------------------- .
                     12
]]></artwork>
</figure>
      Since PVQ codes N-2 degrees of freedom, its distortion should also be
      (N-2) times the gain distortion, which eventually leads us to the optimal
      number of pulses
<figure align="center">
<artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
          gamma*sin(theta)       / N + C - 2 \
      K = ----------------  sqrt | ---------  | .
                  b              \     2     /
]]></artwork>
</figure>
      </t>
      <t>The value of K does not need to be coded because all the variables it
      depends on are known to the decoder.
      However, because Q_theta depends on the gain, this can lead to
      unacceptable loss propagation behavior in the case where inter prediction
      is used for the gain.
      This problem can be worked around by making the approximation
      sin(theta)~=theta.
      With this approximation, then tau is equal to the inverse of the theta
      quantization index, with no dependency on the gain.
      Alternatively, instead of quantizing theta, we can quantize sin(theta)
      which also removes the dependency on the gain.
      In the general case, we quantize f(theta) and then assume that 
      sin(theta)~=f(theta). A possible choice of f(theta) is a quadratic
      function of the form:
<figure align="center">
<artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
                                    2
      f(theta) = a1 theta - a2 theta.
]]></artwork>
</figure>
      where a1 and a2 are two constants satisfying the constraint that
      f(pi/2)=pi/2. 
      The value of f(theta) can also be predicted, but in case where we care
      about error propagation, it should only be predicted from information
      coded in the current frame.
      </t>
    </section>
      

    <section title="Bi-prediction">
      <t>We can use this scheme for bi-prediction by introducing a second theta
      parameter. 
      For the case of two (normalized) reference frames r1 and r2,
      we introduce s1=(r1+r2)/2 and s2=(r1-r2)/2.
      We start by using s1 as a reference, apply the Householder reflection to
      both x and s2, and evaluate theta1.
      From there, we derive a second Householder reflection from the reflected
      version of s2 and apply it to z. The result is that the theta2 parameter
      controls how the current image compares to the two reference images.
      It should even be possible to use this in the case of fades, using two
      references that are before the frame being encoded.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Coefficient coding">
      <t>Encoding coefficients quantized with PVQ differs from encoding scalar-quantized
      coefficients from the fact that the sum of the coefficients magnitude is known (equal
      to K). It is possible to take advantage of the known K value either through modeling
      the distribution of coefficient magnitude or by modeling the zero runs. In the case of
      magnitude modeling, the expection of the magnitude of coefficient n is modeled as
<figure align="center">
<artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
                          K_n
      E(|y_n|) = alpha * ----- ,
                         N - n
]]></artwork>
</figure>
      where K_n is the number of number of pulses left after encoding coeffients from 0 to n-1
      and alpha depends on the distribution of the coefficients. For run-length modeling, the
      expection of the position of the next non-zero coefficient is given by
<figure align="center">
<artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
                        N - n
      E(|run|) = beta * ----- ,
                         K_n
]]></artwork>
</figure>
      where beta also models the coefficient distribution.
